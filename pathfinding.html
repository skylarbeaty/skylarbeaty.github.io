                            I make a lot of things in 2D in Unity and a conspicuously absent part of Unity Engine is an implementation of any kind of 2D pathfinding. 
                            In the past I had borrowed other people’s public implementations for pathfinding, but after I’d learned about several ways to do this in 
                            my coursework, I was eager to make this for myself. I also saw that the Unity Tilemap system has the potential to be an amazing tool to 
                            handle some aspects of this system. So i decided to make a novel implementation to A* and Djikstra’s pathfinding by using it in conjunction 
                            with the Unity Tilemap system.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For the tilemap portion of this, I wanted the ability to set up the environment using tilemap and be able to use that to figure out what tiles are walkable. I found there could be many ways to do this, for my implementation I have a multi-tilemap setup where one tilemap designates the walkable area (any cell with a tile is walkable) and other tilemaps are used for the remainder of the environment. My implementation would also work perfectly with a separate, invisible, tilemap that is only used for pathfinding, but that's more work and needs to be updated separately. You could make adjustments to my system to make it work with one tilemap filled with scriptable objects, but that would be more useful in a system that requires edge weights, for varying terrain.

                            In A* pathfinding we want to find a path between a start and goal node across a graph of nodes. The algorithm intelligently searches outward from explored nodes by using a cost function to determine which node to explore next. This cost function is a combination of the cost of the path up to that node and a heuristic that guesses how close it is to the goal (usually straight line distance). Here I’m storing the path as a child-parent relationship, adjusting nodes’ parents as it loops through them, until the goal node is reached. This is done in such a way that the goal node's parent is the last node on the path, that node's parent is the 2nd last node on the path, and the nth parent is the nth last node on the path.

                            While I was implementing A* pathfinding, I decided to document how it ran at varying stages of optimization. I first made a very basic version of A*, that didn’t even use a heap, as that's the only data structure used in this algorithm that isn't built into C#. Then I implemented the Heap, so it could find the lowest cost node faster, which is called for each time it looks at a new node. This ran about 26% faster than without the heap. Next I wanted to make an optimization with finding neighbors. The implementation was spending a lot of time finding out which nodes are neighbors to another node, but it's not like they are moving. So I set it up to calculate the once at the start, and that made it an additional 23% faster.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So far throughout this process I had been testing it by running one random walkable point to another random point, and this implementation does reasonably fast (several hundred times a second). However most of the paths needed in a game are to or from a player, who only moves to a new tile every so often. In this case you could run a pathfinding algorithm once, across the entire grid (or subgrid) and set up parentage of nodes so that you could trace a path child to parent all the way to the player’s node, without running any real calculations. I implemented this using Djikstra’s algorithm, as the advantage of A* is that it doesn’t need to explore as many nodes, but we want to explore all of them. The results showed that running this to find only one path was about twice as slow, but paths found after the first are so fast that over 1000 paths it took 99.6% less time than a fully optimized A*, which was so large a difference it was outside of the significant figures to which I could accurately measure.

                        <p>
                            So why use A* at all? Why bother Implementing it? Dijkstra's Algorithm is only better in this narrow case. Any time there is a path needed that is not to or from the player (or other common goal) A* is much faster. This implementation of Dijkstra’s does not terminate until it’s explored all of the walkable nodes, which gives up every advantage that A* has to make it so fast. It needs to do this to create the proper parent structure so that you can trace a path from any node to the goal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This does introduce another problem with this particular implementation of Dijkstra’s versus A*. On very large tilemaps, Djikstra’s time to set up parents could skyrocket. It needs to run every time a player (or goal) moves to a new node. This isn’t a problem I encountered on this project, but it would be relatively easy to implement here. Since it’s a breadth-first search that’s always looking at the lowest path cost node (effectively a circle without terrain weights) it could be easily depth-limited by returning after reaching a certain path cost. It would then need pathfinding agents to use A* for their long trips if they are outside of the area Djikstra’s explored.
                        </p>

                            I took on this project in my spare time in my senior year at Kent State. It was really fun to be able to apply a lot of things I’d learned and tackle a subject that seemed intimidating before I started my degree. It is cool to see this interacting with the tilemap system, which opens up some interesting workflow possibilities. I’m glad I decided to measure the timings on different versions of the algorithm, it was enlightening on how much time I’m really saving, and showed how optimal a combination of Djikstra’s and A* can be.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is one project I see myself actually revisiting in the future. I make games that often need this kind of pathfinding, and in any kind of large project I can see additions I’d like to make. I would certainly want to depth-limit the Djikstra’s, as I mentioned before. I read that you can use scriptable objects to encode data in tile map tiles like weights for difficult terrain, and other things; that would be nice to have available to me.
