                    Game Programmer and Game Designer. 
                    Receiving my Bachelor of Computer Science degree (May 2021). <br>
                    I have made a lot of small games. 
                    I want to make bigger experiences alongside talented developers.<br>

                            An arcade shooter, designed around mobile friendly controls, where you play on new stages every run. 
                            It was released on the App Store and

                            The procedural levels work by intelligently pasting pixel textures on top of eachother, and using that to spawn the levels enemies. 
                            The Implementation of the user interface makes use of Unity's scriptable objects in order to work with the procedurally generated shops and levels.

                            Procedural Generation
                        </h4>
                        <p>I’ve created several different methods of procedurally generating levels, including custom solutions for my own projects, 
                            like I did for Phase Drift. I’ve also recreated methods from popular games, like
                            <a href="https://github.com/wbeaty/binding-of-isaac-style-procedural-generation"> Spelunky</a>, 
                            <a href="https://github.com/wbeaty/binding-of-isaac-style-procedural-generation"> The Binding of Isaac,</a> and 
                            <a href="https://github.com/wbeaty/ProceduralGenerationOfNuclearThrone">Nuclear Throne.</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I continually come back to procedural generation as an area of study, exploring different ways it can be done. Nuclear Throne uses a 
                            random walker (pictured), while Spelunky and Isaac rely on mixing templates with rules for how “rooms” connect. Phase Drift has a template system 
                            that was made specially for it. There are areas of proc gen I have been studying that I hope to implement at some point, like 
                            Wave Function Collapse or Hybrid Systems with both procedural and hand craft elements. I have a special interest in roles that allow me 
                            to explore this niche.

                            I have many different projects from game-jams, hackathons, coursework, and personal projects. Help two birds find their way through a hedge maze in

                            The GIF here is a <a href="https://github.com/skylarbeaty/curved-world"> Curved World</a> shader, 
                            which mimics an effect in Animal Crossing, and other games. It displaces the vertices of the meshes along a parabola while rendering. 
                            I have hooks into the shader to customize that parabola, which allows for rounding and softening the curvature at different camera angles.
