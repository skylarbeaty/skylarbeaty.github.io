            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>This was made as a semester long project for the last class in the Game Design sequence at Tri-C. The prompt was to make a game throughout 
                the semester, and we were encouraged to upload it publicly at the end. I made it my challenge to make an Android game, with platform integration 
                and monetization by the end of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I played a lot of different space shooter arcade games growing up; Galaga, Space Invaders, Phoenix (on my TI-84). I missed playing these games 
                but I couldn't find any good alternatives on mobile. Many of the games had very clunky on-screen controls and were filled with glitches or questionable 
                design choices. I set out to make a game that brought the old-school action I craved to mobile, while keeping the scope small enough to complete on time.

                    <p>
                        Most of the old arcade shooters are designed so that they restart every time you die, which is something I enjoy in the roguelike games I play as well. 
                        Unlike rogue-likes, many of the old arcade shooters have the exact same levels every time, which leads to strategies like robotically racing to memorized 
                        safe spots. I avoided this, and generally made the game more interesting to replay, by adding random stage generation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had already made a system that accepts a 2D pixel image to spawn the level, as a simple tool to make designing them easier. So the system I made to 
                        generate levels outputs the same thing, meaning the templates I eventually made were simple to make as well.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                    The system works by pasting enemy layouts on top of each other. Combining multiple templates on top of each other compounds the output of my work. Each enemy 
                    in the game had multiple sets of templates that varied in the amount. The game maintains a progression by introducing new enemies in a set order through the game. 
                    Here’s a rundown of how it generates:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Selects 3-5 enemies to use in varying difficulties, depending on the current stage
        
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For each enemy, select the correct template set, and randomly pick a template
        
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stack enemy templates from easiest to hardest enemy
        
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pass final image to the spawner to start the level
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="row projet-row">
                <span>
                    <!-- [gid of menu transitions] -->

                    <h3>Menus</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Menus in Phase Drift are very modular. I implemented a system to manage the menus so that I could use 
                        the exact same menus in game as on the start screen. It also benefited me by making menu creation and animation 
                        easier. And implemented duplication of work in many ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each submenu has its own prefab and script. The prefabs contain the Unity UI canvas. The script controls any special behavior for the menu, links buttons to actions, and inherits basic menu behavior (like going back a menu, triggering routine animations). This system also keeps the submenus well-contained from each other. Generally adding a submenu could be a quite tedious task by default, but with this system I spent more of that time making cool layouts and animations.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Scriptable Objects</h3>
                    <p>
                        Scriptable objects are used in a few places in this project. This is the first project I was able to get real use 
                        out of them, and they can be very handy! Scriptable objects can be used to store data as an asset. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing that's kept track of this way is the music. The music tracks have a bunch of metadata and they need to 
                        be kept track of by various systems. The audio manager needs to play the correct song, the menu UI needs to display 
                        all the ones you have unlocked, with name and artist, the unlockable system touches it when you unlock one and also 
                        whenever saved data is loaded from the cloud. With a scriptable object I can pass this data around without needing 
                        to worry about errors in duplication and changes, and without having dangling references to master data holders.
                    </p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>
                One of my big takeaways from this project is just how important marketing a game is. This was only a school project, but 
                I still spent a little bit on marketing, more to see how those systems work than anything (I knew it was too little to see 
                a real return without massive luck). The game was monetized with ads, and the ability to remove them. Poking around at these 
                systems gave me a much deeper appreciation for what marketers do.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I was going to do anything different design wise, it would be to add bosses, which were cut adjusting scope for time. 
                Bosses would givethe game more of a sense of progression, and would have changed up the gameplay a bit.
                Doing the implementation again, I would make much further use of scriptable objects, and use data scriptures that I’ve 
                learned throughout my Computer Science education.
